* Noteworthy changes in the upcoming release

  This version adds support for reordering sparse matrices based on
  the nested dissection algorithm as implemented by the METIS graph
  partitioner.

  It is also now easier to build with a user-defined BLAS library.

  mtxrand was added to generate random matrices and vectors in Matrix
  Market format.

  mtxgemm was added to compute matrix-matrix products. This can be
  used to benchmark matrix-matrix multiplication (gemm) in BLAS
  libraries.


* Noteworthy changes in release 0.2.0 (2022-06-28)

  MPI support is added for many operations, such as sorting and vector
  operations. There is work in progress to implement distributed
  sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

  Several implementations for vector operations now provided,
  including a serial implementation, a BLAS-accelerated
  implementation, and an OpenMP shared-memory parallel
  implementation.

  Matrices can now be reordered using Reverse Cuthill-McKee and
  partitioned using METIS.


* Noteworthy changes in release 0.1.0 (2021-06-18)

  This is the initial release of Libmtx, which supports reading and
  writing Matrix Market files, sorting sparse matrices and basic BLAS
  operations, such as matrix-vector multiplication.
